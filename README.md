## Pick Up The Milk!
A web application designed for tracking collaborative shopping lists and costs in shared households. Made using Python/Django.

### Running the Application

### More information

This application was written as part of a group project at the University of Glasgow. My contribution to the project mainly focused on implementing application logic using Python, dynamic HTML generation using Django's template system, and structure of URLs. I also implemented user profiles, user authentication using the registration redux package, and integration with the Google Maps API. Additional contributions were related to the architecture of database models and aspects of frontend development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX.
